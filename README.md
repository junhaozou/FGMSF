# 🧠 Abstract
To address the challenges faced in the fusion and analysis of single-cell multimodal data, such as information misalignment between modalities, data redundancy, severe noise interference, and inconsistent scales. This article proposes a multi-stage fusion clustering analysis model (FGMSF) based on the forget gate mechanism, which can output a low dimensional embedded manifold space while achieving high-quality reconstruction results and efficient and accurate clustering effects. And in the evaluation of downstream tasks, FGMSF not only significantly improves clustering performance, but also demonstrates excellent performance in feature dimension, batch effect removal, multimodal data integration, cell trajectory inference, and has good biological interpretability.
